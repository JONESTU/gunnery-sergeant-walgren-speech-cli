# gunnery-sergeant-walgren-speech-cli
Animated text of Gunnery Sergeant Brian Walgren's speech to Alpha Company, 1st Battalion, 6th Marines troops before the assault on Marjah, Afghanistan on CLI.

## Description
I was motivated by Gunnery Sergeant Brian Walgren's speech which emphasized the importance of people who self sacrifice. I wanted a transcribed version of the video to read, so I made this program to write the speech as if it were closed captioning. I listened to the video and transcribed it myself for this program. I removed all the swears and replaced them with grawlixes (@!*).

## What I Practiced
- Printing text in real time using Python onto the CLI

## Installation and Use
`git clone https://github.com/JONESTU/gunnery-sergeant-walgren-speech-cli.git`

`gunnery_sgt_walgren_speech.py`
